About parallel coordinates : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates

## Controls
You have two controls :
- Number of lines : From 1 to 20, define the number of grey lines representing data through the different scales
- Generate random datas

For demonstration purposes, I picked 5 scales (a to e). You can add or remove some of them directly in the code to adapt to your datas.
